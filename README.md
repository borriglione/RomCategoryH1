RomCategoryH1
=============

A Magento extension to allow a special value for the h1-title of a category view page

- A new attribute "Titre H1" will be added to the category object
- This new attribute "Titre H1" can be managed by the normal category edit view
- the value will be only used in the &lt;h1&gt;-tag of the category view / product list page instead of the category name
- if no value for "Titre H1" was given, the category name will be used as normal
